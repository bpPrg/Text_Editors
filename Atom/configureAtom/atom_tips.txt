00. WARNINGS:
if we install package project-viewer (NOT manager)
the buttom packages in toolbar will not work good.


0. Main note Faulty packages:
a. save-sesson gives error in mac, do  not install it.
b. script setting Default CWD as the location of script.


First things to do after installation
======================================
enable package autosave from settings

1. some keybindings
ctrl shift p ==> preference (ubuntu)
ctrl t       ==> fuzzy finder (pre-installed) lists files in pwd
view>panes>split left ==> new splitted tab
ctrl shf d ==> duplicate the line
ctrl shift " ==> toggle-quotes


python tools:
ctrl alt e   select string inside quotes, then copy it.
ctrl alt u   show all uses of that variable,
             ctrl click the all the variables then
             edit them.
ctrl alt g   if we click this in any instances of
             given function, it will go to the original
             definition of that function


2. multiline edit
ctrl click different words and edit them
note: ctrl arrow right left can be used to go to end of words.

3. insert sequential number
ctrl click the places
ctrl alt 0  then for 5 to rest:  just type 5
                 : for increment 5 + 2  give 5,7,9 etc
                 : for decrement 5 - 2 gives 5,3,1 etc
                 : for increment 0027 + 3 gives 0027, 0030 etc

4. Using github in atom
look dropbox/atom/keymaps.

5. package typewriter removes line numbers and makes it plain text

6. create custom toolbar icons
install two packages:
tool-bar and flex-tool-bar

when flex-tool-bar is instaled we can see the setting icon,
clicking it opens toolbar.cson file.
then edit that file.
hints are given at:
https://atom.io/packages/tool-bar-config

7. atom editor run latex scripts in ubuntu
install latexmk and xpdf from synaptic manager.

8. latex plus in mac
go to settings of latex-plus and give tex and ps2pdf path.
which tex gives: /Library/TeX/texbin/tex
which ps2pdf gives:  /usr/local/bin/ps2pdf

Then, we do not get notifications each time we open atom, that
please give installation path for latex-plus.

9. Time format for file header
install file-header package
go to settings:
change date time format to
DD-MMM-YYYY HH:MM gives
@Last modified time: 08-Nov-2016 20:11

look moment.js file from settings of this package.
or, pdf datetime folder I saved.



10. Terminals
a. term3   it's good install it, it opens in new tab and defaults to first path
b. open-terminal-here   ctrl shift t (create it) to open terminal externally.
c. atom-terminal  not needed
d. terminal-plus most downloaded but not needed, it stays at bottom of page.

11. Some packages
atom-alignment   aligns variables a = 3, b   = 5 etc.
filesize   # current file size on status bar
tree-ignore  # ignore files/folders in tree view
tabs-to-spaces # leading tabs and spaces conversion

12. file-header  tips
do not activate auto adding headers to new file,
if i create input.txt, it will add the header to each and every file we
open in atom editor.

13. linter-pep8 tips
disable some error settings
E221  # spaces around = sign
E127  # overindentation of multiline code after +\
